<h2>Tedchnologies Used</h2>

    - HTML5
    - CSS3
    - JavaScript
    - GitHub - Used to deployed the page

<h2>Difficulties</h2>
It was difficult trying to style all the pages using one css stylesheet. I wantes different styling for all the pages. I was able to give different ID/Classes which allowed me to be able to use one stylesheet and styled all the pages according to my liking.

<h2>Improvements and Modifications</h2>
Would like to upgrade the design of the pages and add more functionality. This application is open to contributions and modifications. If you see where improvements need to be made, feel free to send a pull request.
