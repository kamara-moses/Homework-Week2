# Homework-Week2
Week 2 Homework assignment includes index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html
Created three files on my repository.
The first file is About Me/Biography named index.html
The nav-bar has functional links to the other files on the repository
Added an image of my family, with a little description of me on the right of it.
Added a sticky footer at the bootom with my name as the creator/author of the page.

The second file is my Portfolio page named portfolio.html
The nav-bar has functional links to the other files on the repository
Added five images on the page using the grid system from bootstrap
One of the images is of a project am working on currently called ACEs
Added a sticky footer at the bootom with my name as the creator/author of the page.

The third file is my Contact page named contact.html
The nav-bar has functional links to the other files on the repository
The forms have required attribute added to them so users have to input information before submitting the form
Added a sticky footer at the bottom with my name as the creator/author of the page

The fourth file that was just added was an extension of the contact.html. When the submit button is click, a thank you message will open within the same window. This will let the user know that there submission was processed and sent.

This files will eventually be utilized for my personal while job hunting and other aspects of my career.
Tried to maintain consistency among the three sites and made sure it responsive.
